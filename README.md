# PhotoAlbumSynth
#
#
#
#Space where I am going to upload code for a silly photo album synth i wanna do
#I have too many pictures saved that I want to play with in weird ways
#
#I'm going to mainly be using different keys
#Some will toggle different streams
    #Ex. keys a-f toggle through streams (like this--when "a"||"A" pressed reference matrix of photos named "screenshots")
    #
#Some will toggle different effects
    #Ex. keys q-y flow through different effects (like when "q"||"Q" change tint/make tint audio reactive)
    #Change effect mode? (timeline, external, only change while key pressed)?
      #Use separate key & layer such that i can: apply change KeyActive(e) to mode(timeline) when key "i"||"I" pressed
#How will effects envelope other effects?

# PhotoAlbumSynth

#
#Space where I am going to upload code for a silly photo album synth i wanna do
<br>
#I have too many pictures saved that I want to play with in weird ways
<br>
<br>
#I'm going to mainly be using different keys
<br>
#Some will toggle different streams
<br>
    ########Ex. keys a-f toggle through streams (like this--when "a"||"A" pressed reference matrix of photos named "screenshots")
    <br>
    #
    <br>
#Some will toggle different effects
<br>
    ########Ex. keys q-y flow through different effects (like when "q"||"Q" change tint/make tint audio reactive)
    <br>
    ########Use separate key & layer such that i can: apply change KeyActive(e) to mode(timeline) when key "i"||"I" pressed
    <br>
#How will effects envelope other effects?
<br>
